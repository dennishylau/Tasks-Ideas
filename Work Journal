20171027_1506 Debugged with Mrs Leung, gave her 300 PNS coupon for helping debug
20171026_1634 So the add listing flow does not work. Fuck me. Now I know: spare absolutely no effort on testing. Don't be stupid. Don't rely on people.
20171026_1420 Just called Mrs Leung, problem with listing a new property, iOS app returns 放盤成功 but CMS no record. Investigating, tmr 1430 she might come by

20171008_1354 Called the Ms Lau concerning her 中山 listing, removed proeprty
20171007_1937 Just had a Mr Chan come in, tank top, pretty tanned. He was interested in shop sale

20171005_1845 let me develop some 10 seconds pitch
    All the main points:
    永久免費
    推廣優惠
    高位放盤
20171005_1751 Third guy today. KK who works in fortress.
20171005_1735 All the verification all those crap ain't gonna work, no one cares enough about the 100 bucks to do shit about it
20171005_1732 What if I make some flowers out of parknshop coupon, something big IDK
20171005_1718 Oh just got 2 people walking in! talked for a bit, asked some questions.
20171005_1702 I have some theories why this is not working.
    (1) People are inheritly skeptical of free goodies
    (2) Sounds like too much trouble
    (3) Too little money, not worth the time
    I am thinking, how about something ridiculous? What if I just ask the person (1) are you a owner (2) you want to sell your property, both yes then I give a $50 coupon? Install the app, come back and I give $50 more?
20171005_1658 Not a single person came throught the door. Ouch.
20171005_1548 First day. Opened for an hour or so, not even a single person in. Oh well.
