20171005_1751 Third guy today. KK who works in fortress.
20171005_1735 All the verification all those crap ain't gonna work, no one cares enough about the 100 bucks to do shit about it
20171005_1732 What if I make some flowers out of parknshop coupon, something big IDK
20171005_1718 Oh just got 2 people walking in! talked for a bit, asked some questions.
20171005_1702 I have some theories why this is not working.
    (1) People are inheritly skeptical of free goodies
    (2) Sounds like too much trouble
    (3) Too little money, not worth the time
    I am thinking, how about something ridiculous? What if I just ask the person (1) are you a owner (2) you want to sell your property, both yes then I give a $50 coupon? Install the app, come back and I give $50 more?
20171005_1658 Not a single person came throught the door. Ouch.
20171005_1548 First day. Opened for an hour or so, not even a single person in. Oh well.
